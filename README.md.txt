# REST API Basic Project

## What is this?

This is a basic REST API project template that provides a simple structure for building API services. It includes modules for handling authentication, basic calculator functionalities, currency operations, database interactions, and user-related functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `.gitignore`: Gitignore file to specify files and directories that should be ignored by version control.

- `app.py`: Main file for running the REST API server.

- `auth.py`: Module containing authentication-related functionalities.

- `calc.py`: Module containing basic calculator functionalities (example functionality).

- `config.json`: Configuration file storing project-specific configurations.

- `currency.py`: Module handling currency-related functionalities.

- `database.py`: Module handling database interactions.

- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the Python dependencies required for the project. Install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- `user.py`: Module containing user-related functionalities.

## How To Use This?
